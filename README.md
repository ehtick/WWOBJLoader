`OBJLoader2` is a loader for the `OBJ` file format. It is an alternative to `OBJLoader` included in [three.js](https://threejs.org). The loader and its parser can be used on Main via `OBJLoader2` or in parallel inside a web worker via `OBJLoader2Parallel`.

New versions of `OBJLoader2` and `OBJLoader2Parallel` are from now on again released as npm modules independent of three.js. The first stable version that was released independent again is 4.0.0. Versions 3.x.y were never released as independent npm and only in combination with three.js itself.

# Development

## Getting Started

There exist three possibilities:
* Press the `Gitpod` button above and start coding and using the examples directly in the browser
* Checkout the repository and use `docker-compose up -d` to spin up local snowpack dev server.
* Checkout the repository and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to spin up local snowpack dev server

Whatever environment you choose to start [snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) is used to serve the code and the examples using it. With this setup you are able to change the code and examples without invoking an additional bundler. Snowpack ensures all imported npm modules are available if previously installed in local environment (see `npm install`).

If you run snowpack locally you require a `nodejs` and `npm`. The Gitpod and local docker environment ensure all prerequisites are fulfilled.

In any environment the server is reachable on port 8085.

## Examples

If you want to get started see take a look at the following examples. They get more advanced from top to bottom:  
* [OBJLoader2 direct loader Test](public/examples/webgl_loader_obj2.html)
* [OBJLoader2Parallel Worker Module Support](public/examples/webgl_loader_obj2_workermodulesupport.html)
* [OBJLoader2(Parallel) usage options](public/examples/webgl_loader_obj2_options.html)
* [WorkerTaskManager: Potentially Infinite](public/examples/wtm_potentially_infinite.html)

## Main Branches

Main development now takes place on branch [dev](https://github.com/kaisalmen/WWOBJLoader/tree/dev).
<br>
The stable branch contains the release versions available with three.js is available on branch [stable](https://github.com/kaisalmen/WWOBJLoader/tree/stable).

## Docs
Run `npm run doc` to create the documentation in directory **build/docs**.
 
## Additional models and resources
Use the following script `bash dev/models/retrieveExtras.sh` to download missing resources (OBJ, MTL files and textures). 


# Feature Overview

## OBJLoader2Parser
The parser `OBJLoader2Parser` used by `OBJLoader2` and `OBJLoader2Parallel` has all OBJ parsing capabilities of `OBJLoader` from three.js, plus some extra feature. Please see the following list:
- The `parse` methods of `OBJLoader2Parser` accepts `ArrayBuffer` or `String` as input. Text processing is approx. 15-20 pecent slower.
- In case `OBJLoader2Parallel` the of Parser `OBJLoader2Parser` is executed inside a worker.
- `OBJLoader2Parser` features indexed rendering including vertex reduction.
- Indexed rendering is available if switched on via `setUseIndices` (see `useIndices` in example **[OBJLoader2 usage options](public/examples/webgl_loader_obj2_options.html#L133)**).
- Face N-Gons are supported.
- Multi-Materials are created when needed.
- Flat smoothing defined by "s 0" or "s off" is supported and Multi-Material is created when one object/group defines both smoothing groups equal and not equal to zero.
- Support for points and lines is available since V2.3.0.
- New mesh detection relies on 'g' occurrence or 'f', 'l' or 'p' type change (since V2.3.0). This allows multiple mesh definitions within one group.
- Negative face indices are supported (issue #28)
- The parser is now a single class that can be directly stored as string and therefore embedded in module or standard Workers (since V4.0.0).

## OBJLoader2 & OBJLoader2Parallel 
- Console logging is deactivated by default. It can be enabled by switching [here]() including debug logging.
- TypeScript definitions (d.ts) are generated from JSDoc definitions for free from it, see [declaration](./dev/declaration.tsconfig.json)

## WorkerTaskManager

The [WorkerTaskManager](https://github.com/kaisalmen/three-wtm) handles everything regarding workers. This is now a completely independent project and library that is utilized by `OBJLoader2Parallel`. 

Happy coding!
